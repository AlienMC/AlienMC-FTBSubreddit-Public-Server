§1§lAMC 2.4 Intro
Welcome to AlienMc 2.4. 
This time around, we've decided to spice things up a bit.
NEI use is really important for this version of the pack because we've changed many recipes. 
The changes are meant to be somewhat more challenging, yet still fun.
You've probably noticed that Project E is in the pack. Don't worry, you won't have to use it to be on the same level as other players.
Project E is gated to be later game, and only building blocks, and some items that are unimportant to progression have EMC.
"But Project E is like playing in creative mode" Yeah. For building blocks. You'll be able to build nicer things more easily.
We've added Spice of Life. The diminishing returns only affects the saturation level(Those golden glowy bits behind the food bar.) of foods. 
Your steak will still return 5 nuggets, but if that's the only food you eat, that's all it will restore.
Hunger Overhaul has also been added. 
-Cows will only be able to be milked every 10 real life minutes.
-Underground farms, or any farm not in sunlight will take 10 times longer.
-You wooden and stone hoes can not be crafted. Try a tinker's mattock :D
