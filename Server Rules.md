* No Hacking, glitching, exploiting (If you find a bug or exploit, please inform an admin through Discord/ModMail on reddit)

* No CC programs that create an infinite loop without a sleep function

* No TPS checking

* No Griefing

* No lag machines - Do not allow farms/machines to back up or spew.

* No Afking for long periods or making Anti-Afk setups
 
* No building within 100 blocks of spawn's claimed chunks. (You can ask a staff member for an exception)

* No Automated mining in the Overworld or Nether. (Yes you can use pumps)

This is a safe space for everyone regardless of race, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
Chunks can be claimed and loaded using FTB Utils. 
Loaded chunks will only be active while you are online.  
Have common sense, and do your best to be nice to others.  
Admins may ban users both for broken rules and any malicious actions towards the server.  
Appeal bans in Discord or via modmail.
